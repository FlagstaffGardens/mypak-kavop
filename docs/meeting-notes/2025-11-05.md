[Speaker A]:
Hi. Hello? Hello?


[Speaker B]:
Hello. Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Can you hear me?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. Sorry, I took my daughter home.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, all right. Yeah. No, all good. All good? Yeah. That's. That's your Cosmos. I can't really find out one of them, but then I think one of them is your customer. I don't really know what's your exact name, using some weird language. I don't know if you recognize any, just in case.


[Speaker B]:
No, I'm just going through it. Which one? From the pictures, you mean? Yeah. Oh, cl. Right. What, they get like, 80 containers from just this? Fine. Are you sure that's the only.


[Speaker A]:
Yes, they only sell paper, like corrugated paper cartons. Look, the estimate is not guaranteed, but basically, back in 2013, right, when they didn't have any scale, they say they were making 30 million patterns a year. This is from them, right?


[Speaker B]:
Right.


[Speaker A]:
So 2013, they only had three lines. They were doing 30 million, right? Now they said they have 15 lines. Right. So conservative estimation is around 100, 150. It's not guaranteed. But then they definitely got some scale.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, but then why didn't they pay for the continuation of their patents?


[Speaker A]:
Because I told you, right? Patents always expire after 15 or 20 years.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
They started the patent back in 2002. It expired in 2022. Like, it becomes public domain after 20 years.


[Speaker B]:
So what you want to do, so now that you actually have this, this document, this patent document.


[Speaker A]:
No, no, no. Whatever the pattern they have, it's. It's. It's not, you know, it's not a manual how to make it. Right. You just have some of the key innovations on how to do it, which is going to be very helpful when we build our own line. But it doesn't have, you know, the end to end everything. We still have to figure out the manufacturing process. Yeah, but at least it helps, right? It's going to help massively.


[Speaker B]:
Better than nothing, I guess.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah. They're not going to give us everything, as you can imagine, but then it's better than nothing.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
I mean, I already have the diel line. I already have the structure. I already have the sample. How much better can get, right? Yeah, I don't know how much better can get.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. So. Yeah. All right, hold on. Let's just talk about one thing at a time. Let me just open up focus flow right now, just so we have in front of ourselves, focus float. Right. Doctor, Refresh. Do I. I can't see any. Okay, yeah, yeah, you gotta refresh.


[Speaker A]:
Just refresh it. Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
Right. So this AI memory in context, what's that? Okay.


[Speaker A]:
You just click on it. You can see all the facts from that call, right. Relevant to that task.


[Speaker B]:
What's the sources?


[Speaker A]:
I was going to add the sources, but then I didn't end up doing it. Just a UI thing. I was going to quote the specific call or the meeting summary, whatever from it. I personally found that to be useful, but then I didn't do it. I just. I can remove it later.


[Speaker B]:
All right.


[Speaker A]:
And then the activity just really to show when did you assign something to someone? What's a comment, you know?


[Speaker B]:
Okay, see, this is my thing, right? Yeah. All right. See, I'm just saying, like, this is my feeling, right? The way that I actually handle all my tasks is I'll kind of have a list, right? Like, I'll kind of have a list. Like I have a piece of paper in front of me with all this stuff that I need to get done, right? And I feel like transferring it from this list to my piece of paper in terms of things that I need to get done. And so I feel like writing down tiles that I already have on my piece of paper, but I feel like just deleting it there. And I feel like if I need to actually know something more about it later, I'll just go and chat with my memory. How do you use this product? How do you use this product?


[Speaker A]:
Right. So how do I use this product? Basically, our meeting transcript, I upload it and then I see the same thing. And basically out of each call, like, actually, so most of the things that's generated out of this, actually, I'm going to use a straight way, basically, for example.


[Speaker B]:
But do you keep your list? Do you keep your list there or do you delete them or what do you do with them?


[Speaker A]:
Do I keep my list there? I actually, when I'm done, I'm done. For example, Give me an example. One of the tasks that was on mine was tell Shenzhen company to, you know, not. Not disclose this information to anyone else. Right? That was one of the tasks that was there. I sent a message to them that market is complete. Well, I get them done. Like either things I think shouldn't be on it, I delete or things like I'm done, I press complete. Done. There's nothing. I mean, you look at your list right now, right? How would you do it? I'm looking at the same thing as uterus.


[Speaker B]:
Well, so my sense is I just want to make sure that I've got it on my things to do on my piece of paper and I'll just delete it. Because I can't have this list continue to grow like this. So I want to just. It's a little bit like my email.


[Speaker A]:
You can assign this thing to yourself or delete or complete. I don't see what's here.


[Speaker B]:
More than three quarters of it are for me and it's too much stuff to have on the list.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, then are you saying that you don't want to do this task or this task looks.


[Speaker B]:
No, no, no, I have it on my list. No, no, no. I have to do them. Not a matter of I don't want to or why don't I have to do it.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, but you just don't want them to be on the focus for product. You want them to be an arbitrary piece of paper.


[Speaker B]:
No, I don't. I can't manage such a long list. I can't manage it getting to like. Like before it was on Excel, it was getting up to like 100 items or something, right? And it was too much for me to manage just to read through and manage 100 items. It wasn't a nice way of handling a to do list by having so many items.


[Speaker A]:
Question then, did you. Did you give that list to ChatGPT and try to get ChatGPT to advise you on what. What I think to do? I don't know.


[Speaker B]:
I can't even copy and paste this into Chat GPT, by the way.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, okay. All right. Simply just tell me right now. Like, so you're saying you don't want to look at this list, you just want to remove them and then you want to retain these things, you just want to reorganize everything again, something like todoist or piece of paper.


[Speaker B]:
What I'm trying to say is I like this list, but I find this UI as too overwhelming. I think there's too many items on it for me to manage.


[Speaker A]:
What about this? Right?


[Speaker B]:
I need some way to organize it or something.


[Speaker A]:
I was thinking another way to do it is basically you have four different toggles of categories, right? You have your mypack, you have your personal, you have others and whatever. And that's going to show you how many new items within each category. For example, you don't want to look at anything else, you just want to look at my pack stuff. You click on my pack and it will look at all the stuff from my pack. Is that something interesting? I don't know.


[Speaker B]:
Actually.


[Speaker A]:
I'll tell you what. Normally people don't really have five, six different businesses that work at the same time. Maybe you must, but normally People. When you say, for example, you're a real estate agent, right, and you're on this, then your categories might just be rental buyers, I don't know, like a very concentrated work related stuff. Your contact is a lot more concentrated than this.


[Speaker B]:
No, not necessarily. I think everyone's got stuff on, right? Not. Isn't everyone busy? We're generally designed for different people, right? Like to say if you're a doctor or a lawyer, you get multiple cases on at the same time.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, we can't be building the product for everyone, right? Let's focus on you. So tell me what's the problem with like what's the problem when you're using it right now? You've only used it for less than 24 hours, right? Have you really thought about it?


[Speaker B]:
I wanted to just share with you my immediate, my immediate impression, my first impression.


[Speaker A]:
What's your comments?


[Speaker B]:
So the overall feeling at the moment that I had with the product was it's a lot of items, right?


[Speaker A]:
You had the same thing for the previous CSV files. I don't understand. You're looking at CSV file and you say, let's turn this into a product. Now you look at the product, you're like, oh, you know, it's exactly the same as CSV file, but it's too much. I still understand.


[Speaker B]:
Exactly. So no, no, but when I was.


[Speaker A]:
Designing the product, I told you, right? I said, I think it's going to be too overwhelming. You said, okay, I want to have this list. I must have it.


[Speaker B]:
No, no, no. I really like it now.


[Speaker A]:
It's completely different.


[Speaker B]:
By the way, I still think it's really, really valuable. Like I'm just, look, honestly speaking, I'm just telling you in real time the way I'm using the product, right? So in real time what I'm doing is I'm going through this whole list of things that I have to do, right? And I actually found a lot of things that I've forgotten and I've added it to my piece of paper, right? Like that is super valuable. I'm not trying to play that down. That was a super valuable thing. Like there's a bunch of stuff there that I didn't have, right? I'm probably counting about six items there that I actually forgotten about, right. That are sit between the cracks, right. I've now got that in.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
So I think that that was good. Now if you take this product away from me, I'm gonna miss it, right? Because that was, it gave me an immediate sense of Satisfaction straight away, by the way. Right? Like that. Really.


[Speaker A]:
Right.


[Speaker B]:
So what I'm talking about now, something different, right? And I'm actually okay with all those. I'm okay with all those things that you mentioned, like about, yeah, I'm okay with everything that you mentioned there about, about needing all those extra features and stuff like that. I'm actually okay with them. I'm happy to leave them. Alright. What I'm talking about now, right, Is, you know, how can we make this potentially more organized on the front end, right. Rather than me writing stuff down on a piece of paper, there's actually a mechanism for people to kind of keep stuff. So. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would have thought, honestly, like I would have thought for some of this sort of stuff. I don't know, it's difficult to say. Look, my sense of this, right, is that if I was able to organize it, that would definitely help, right? And then organize and effectively instead of us reimagining this.


[Speaker A]:
Right. I think what would be really helpful is you write down your current pain in using the product, right? Like be very succinct with what you're trying to say. Like, I mean, I understand what you're trying to do right now, but I think it's worthwhile if we have the process write them down in like a paragraph and actually I actually asked Clark Code on how to resolve this problem and propose three different solutions, right? Because I look at Clark Code's answer, it's better than any fucking thing we could come up with honestly, right? From a product perspective, it's genuinely just a smarter person than me if you give the right prompt. So that's what I would do. And trying to reimagine how to do the solution, I feel like it's going to be a waste of time and it's worthwhile for you to basically write them down and really think about, you know, like really think about what you can say to a really smart person, right? And then I will kind of play back and forth with Cloud Co to have something as how do you resolve this new problem? But then you had to write it down very successfully because me just talking to you right now, it's kind of like I haven't really quite understood what are you trying to achieve. I know you're trying to put them on paper, you want to find a better way to organize it. But then what's the underlying pain? What's the underlying purpose and what are you looking for? Right. I think running them down will really help you to think about this kind of thing.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Does that make sense?


[Speaker B]:
All right, agreed.


[Speaker A]:
Agreed.


[Speaker B]:
But look, I just wanted to say. Look, overall, I just wanted to talk to you out loud about how I felt about the product. Overall, I really liked it. Like, I thought it was.


[Speaker A]:
It's not perfect. I'm not quite happy with it, but then I know how to launch. Like, you know, if I'm launching something 100% happy with, then it's wrong. Right. I don't launch something I'm not happy with. There are some bugs here and there. Like, I just. I honestly don't have time to fix it anymore. But it's usable. It's functional right now. So just use it for like a week before I have time to fix it anyway. So whatever this new thing you have, I think it's important we kind of keep a document trail for it. And then I'll use cloudcore to kind of produce new documents for where this product should be. And you have that document I sent you yesterday.


[Speaker B]:
Right.


[Speaker A]:
I thought was pretty good as well. So. Yeah. Anyway. Okay. What else do we want to talk about? Our focus flow. I mean, I would just get.


[Speaker B]:
There's really two things about focus flow that I just wanted to ask you. Number one is, can I download my memory?


[Speaker A]:
Yes. So you can go to the memory cap. Right now I just added the button. Press on export and it's going to give you the markdown file. You can upload to ChatGPT or whatever straight away.


[Speaker B]:
Got it. Okay, cool. Overall, about. How do you feel overall about. I was gonna say. Yeah. How do you feel overall about Google? Like, you know that Tom's. I mean, I can see it on my Google phone. How do you feel about that?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, I did some research on it. Right. And I sent you this link on WeChat. It's called Tom's Guide. They actually show the screenshot of how it worked. Right. Okay. So I haven't used the product at all, but then it was out in the market for like, quite a bit of time. Right. How I feel about it is that Google did every single product under the sun, from CRM to everything. Google has their own version of it, but then they don't end up beating everyone out of the water. Right. And it's really just about us being fault. Okay, let me ask you, is Google's current product solving your problem right now or is it as good as FocusFlow right now? Is it better? I honestly wouldn't worry too much about it because Google try to do Arctic. They try to do everything. I mean, they're really doing everything, literally whatever product you can find. I can find a similar version from Google. Right. But if you worry about them killing us, then I think we're overthinking a little bit right now. We're just going to build the most perfect product for salespeople right now. Right. I wouldn't worry too much about Google. And eventually. I don't think Pixel Phone is a very popular product yet. Everybody still uses an iPhone. When you solve the problem for iPhone.


[Speaker B]:
At least they're not rolling it out across Android. Overall.


[Speaker A]:
I'm pretty sure this thing is a Pixel Phone only thing you can only use on a Pixar. And I don't think a lot of people use Pixar to be honest. Certainly, yeah, I don't think Pixel is that popular yet. We only really got a good product since Pixel 10 before that. Apparently the product was quite shit. Yeah, we should learn from them. You should use it too, because I don't have a Pixel. You are the only one who can use it. You use it even if there's something amazing or good about it, then we'll find out. But actually I look fun on Reddit and stuff. Not many people use it. I can barely find anything about it. Like I can't find much discussion on this feature.


[Speaker B]:
Is eBayCR quite popular?


[Speaker A]:
It's not that popular either. But then they obviously got millions of downloads, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
They are not that popular. Well, they got a million reviews on Google Play Store so I guess they're quite popular. Yeah, they're probably quite popular. But the thing is that they don't have a very strong online community with Cubace ar. There isn't a very. There isn't Reddit or stuff about it. I couldn't find a lot of them.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, I just wanted to say it out loud because yeah, like actually I think that there is something really interesting in this product. The only thing that I'm not sure about overall is how we're going to record the calls and how we're going to make that experience seamless. I think if that was nailed, I reckon that this would be like such an easy home run across the board if we could solve that part of it anyway.


[Speaker A]:
Well, because I think the thing to think about. Maybe you want to put in your question to Claude as well. This is a very difficult problem and there is a business called Plot. The plot making $100 million a year literally solving this problem. Right. Because people have trouble recording their calls through software. Plaud's entire product is based on this pain. And they're making $100 million US a year. Right. So it's a very, very difficult problem to solve, both from a security adoption perspective. And I'm also not quite sure how we solve it either, to be honest.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. All right. All right. So the other thing, I want to talk to you about that a little bit.


[Speaker A]:
You're using Kubeci right now. No problem. So, yeah, anyway, you go. Let's move on.


[Speaker B]:
So the other one was.


[Speaker A]:
I honestly.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, so the other one was around just egg box, as well as the MyPAC BMI thing.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. Let's talk about eggbox right now then. I got a few questions for you for vmi.


[Speaker B]:
Sorry, you go, yeah, well, around the egg box. I think we've kind of already covered it. Right. I know that you're still working with them. I was really just going to ask you if there was any other further update.


[Speaker A]:
The update is we. I mean, so basically we want to achieve two things right now. Number one, the nesting. Number two, closing. Right. For closing, I'm getting their engineers to have a look on how to really make the closing mechanism more solid. The ling already tested on their samples. They actually lock quite strongly, like locks quite well right now just from what it is. And for dnsing, she also tested it. It's not very definitive thing because we only have two samples right now. He thinks that they DNS quite well right now, but then obviously I'm getting them to make like 20 more 15 to 20 more samples. So we can actually test how it works when stacked. Right.


[Speaker B]:
Can I be honest? If they're selling 80 to 100 containers a month, they can't have any significant issues. Maybe they might have had it in early models, but I don't think that they have any of these.


[Speaker A]:
Because you think about it, right? They have three lines and they were making 30 million cartons a year, right. Now they have 15 lines, based on their information. Right. So that's at least five times 30 million, I'm saying. Right. They're making at least. Yeah. Even if we're around half that, they're still making, you know, 40 million, whatever. A reasonable size in Europe. By the way, I read this article. They were actually looking to license this into South America and Australia. But it's like from 12 years ago, this article.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
It'S interesting.


[Speaker B]:
Anyway, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
So you were saying, you know, you've been having such a crazy volume. We shouldn't worry about these kind of things because you kind of already solved it. Right.


[Speaker B]:
I always need to look at it and see if it can be improved. But you know, when you tell me numbers that big, I didn't realize it was that big.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, I mean, I'm not 100% correct, but then, yeah, it looks like. I mean, just an earnings alone, they're making €400,000 a year and have €4 million on their balance sheet. Right. They're not nobody. They got serious financial power as well. Not serious, but I guess sizable. Right. I don't even think MyPAC has 4 million euros on its balance sheet. Right. It's like 30 million. 30 million RMB. It's quite a bend.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. All right, so I think that that's. How far off do you think we are?


[Speaker A]:
What would you like us to move on?


[Speaker B]:
How far off?


[Speaker A]:
How do we move forward with Egg Box right now? How do we move forward with Egg Box then?


[Speaker B]:
I'm getting them to do more snapping it.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. The thing with the product is, I mean, I need to get them to make 10 more samples and then figure out assembly. The assembly part is still something I'm having a headache with. Right. Because I tried to assemble it today. Yeah. It's actually impossible. I mean, it's not impossible. It's actually very challenging to do a human assembly line. It's actually not easy to assemble using human hands. It's actually not easy at all to assemble this thing. It's actually much better to use a machine to do it because, you know, like, it's foldable paper. You need to fold to a very specific angle and then glue it on. Machines are very good at these kind of things, but I think humans are. Human hands are not actually suitable to assemble this product.


[Speaker B]:
Really.


[Speaker A]:
Well, I only tried it today, but I thought it was quite hard to assemble it. And clearly the never. I mean, this German company, they never tried, like, you know, manual assembly line at all. And they did a bunch of innovations for this, by the way. It took them years to figure out how to assemble this, by the way, because they had this condom design back in 2002. They only started manufacturing these things in bulk 10 years later. And I'm looking at the pattern right now. It's actually quite complicated. Like the machine, the design, it's got a lot of hooks and stuff everywhere. I don't even quite understand it yet. But, yeah, it's certainly not as easy as we thought to assemble the thing, at least by hand.


[Speaker B]:
Right.


[Speaker A]:
But honestly, honestly, I look at the automation abilities of China, I think there are a lot of people out there who can do this. I'm Pretty sure.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
But if we want to do that, I need to show people the product. Right? Like the only way for us to figure out assembly, we need to find very smart automation engineers, robotics, whatever that's going to help us customize this line and I don't know, I don't know. I mean you can have a look and see if it's possible to assemble by human hands, right? Because I obviously can't find any information online how to assemble this by hand and I tried it, it's quite hard. So yeah, it's not like putting labels on it. This thing's hard. This thing is very difficult to assemble.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. All right, so that's really our bottleneck right now for eggbox, figuring out how to assemble it. Is that the problem?


[Speaker A]:
Yes, yes. Because I think product wise cost is going to be high but then we're not at a stage to talk about cost with these people at all, Right. Because there's no point negotiating pricing. We need to figure out how to sell the stone gate first. And with assembly, I need to see the Shenzhen company and see to really talk with them how they can do it. But based on my understanding right now, I don't think they're capable of doing this. We have to kind of design it by ourselves, I think.


[Speaker B]:
Do you know anyone who is capable of doing it?


[Speaker A]:
I'm not aware. Look, I told you there's this. I met this company last week at the conference, right? And I think they are pretty at scale and we're actually holding the cartons and I just told them it's not a fully rectangular. I didn't show them anything. I just, you know, like this is a carton king for the kind of. Like this they said they can, right? So I don't know, maybe they've got. Because these companies, right, I think they're a little bit bigger than the Shenzhen company. They're in Dongguan, they're very big. Maybe they are capable of folding this in house, I don't know.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. All right, well anyway, at least we know that we've crossed most of the bridges to get there and the main problem that we have right now is disassembly, right? Is that fair to say?


[Speaker A]:
That's right, that's right, that's right. Once we figure out assembly, I think the product's ready, by the way, I.


[Speaker B]:
Think it's good that it's not easy, right? It's good that it's not easy because it was easy then everyone would do it, right?


[Speaker A]:
Because cutting Paper is very easy, right? Cutting paper, printing paper is easy. Assembly is actually the difficult thing here.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. Look, to be honest, I mean, I don't know how complicated.


[Speaker A]:
It's not a harder thing.


[Speaker B]:
I don't know how complicated it is. China would know. There'd be robotics people in China that would know how to do this, surely.


[Speaker A]:
100%. Yeah. I'm not concerned about assembly at all. But we're going to be willing to share secrets as companies, right? Because, you know, we're not really happy.


[Speaker B]:
I'm sure that they could do it, but you need to find the right company.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker B]:
What do you think of that? Robotics. What do you think about the robotics company that was in robotics quotes for us before?


[Speaker A]:
These people are like the most. Honestly, I don't even think they're good. Like, we're just system integrators of very basic robotic shit. They're not good. I know who's good and who's not. I don't think that tai chi or whatever is good at all.


[Speaker B]:
Okay. I don't know.


[Speaker A]:
I look at them, they don't look sophisticated to me. It's like that be sure, guy, you sound good. I kind of know enough Chinese. I know who's smarter, who isn't. I just don't. I look at them, I don't think they're smart. I don't think.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, well, okay, well, anyway, we better find someone who is smart, who can do it.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
All right.


[Speaker A]:
Would you like me to go on and try to find them? I mean, I would try to meet the Shenzhen company later this week. So would you like me to go on and try to find someone or.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, I think.


[Speaker A]:
How fast we want to move this forward?


[Speaker B]:
Oh, as fast as you can, right? As fast as you can, basically.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. Okay. So I. Basically. So you know, what's next is get the Shenzhen companies to make a bit more paper. We go have a visit there. I want to see a few other companies. The best way to figure out whether people can do this is not give them any product, but to visit some companies in person and show them the product. I feel like that's a safer way to really show the product without telling them the secrets. What do you reckon? Because Lynn had this idea, right, she thinks it's going to be fine showing them the rough structure of the product. They're not going to be able to copy it anyway. And at least, you know, like, they're going to know straight away whether they can do it or not. Instead of us wasting time talking to Them online, back and forth. We don't want to show them the DOT line. Yeah. We want to see if we can make it right. It doesn't make any sense.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, no, I agree, I agree.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. Okay. So basically we just exercise our best judgments. We'll shortlist a few very good companies and make a visit to them and then bring them the samples from the Shenzhen company so they can't see any branding or whatever on it and see if they can make something. Like they can't sample this product at all with your account. I think we should do that.


[Speaker B]:
I don't think we have a choice at the moment. I agree with you. I don't think we have a choice at the moment.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, like, because, I mean, I can't be signing an NDA with error. It's going to take too long. It's going to take like a month for us to do anything. So I just have to bring the product to them and see their factory whether they're capable enough or not and see whether they're smart or not.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
All right, done.


[Speaker B]:
Okay, let me organize that and then.


[Speaker A]:
I'm gonna start finding people now.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah, but I just wonder, like, in terms of, like in terms of the area, it's gonna be mostly Shenzhen, right?


[Speaker A]:
Shenzhen, Dongguan. And just around here, I think it's going to be Dongguan because apparently all the corrugated paper they are made. So it's all towards Shenzhen. Yes, it's all near Shenzhen Donggua. It's all that area, more east.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. But as soon as we know how to. As soon as we know how to. Like, so is the current company, are they actually evaluating anything else or that all our work is done as far as they're concerned? As far as the cardboard guys are concerned, are they. Are we. Do we have everything we need from them or do we still need them to modify more stuff?


[Speaker A]:
Well, ideally we want to try inside printing as well. Right. Because that's what Stonegate wants. They want us to do inside printing as well. But I guess any company can do that, right? Like the whole printing cutting is a very commoditized part of the business. Assembly is actually harder. So from the Shenzhen company wise, we technically don't need anything more from them. Technically we can just find anyone else that can do the same thing because I already have the dialogue. Yeah, I know the dialogue. I know the paper material. I have an actual sample. I honestly can get anyone to do this.


[Speaker B]:
All right, so as long as we get the construction done, I mean, look, so Lynn Basically says that she can't sit think of anything to improve around the detail dnsing and closing. Is that what she said?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. So she's actually asked me. She doesn't know how to improve it so she's saying can we get the Shenzhen companies engineer to help us improve it because she doesn't know then dnsing wise she reckons it's fine. She reckons it's okay. Like she tested it as well and the structure wise is very good. Like the paper quality is very good.


[Speaker B]:
Okay. All right.


[Speaker A]:
Waterproofing wise I haven't really got to that stage yet. We need to kind of make version one first.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. And for the vmi I guess our status for the connect. Right. I'm guessing our status is really just to evaluate that document you sent me that. Is that what you.


[Speaker A]:
Well sir, for the vmi I have a few questions for you. I don't know have you had a chance to look at the product document I sent you this morning? It's called Product Direction. Yeah. So I want to really go through the problems with you. Right. Because I actually spent quite a bit time to talk with Claude back and forth on what the product should be. So have you read it?


[Speaker B]:
I did but it's still. It's not 100% to me it's not really focused.


[Speaker A]:
I don't know. I know, I know but then I have a few questions that I like to know. Right. So I'll go right now. Hold on. Other question number one. Do you think farms want an autopilot feel like mold with how they order their cartons or they like to stay in control.


[Speaker B]:
Do they want to do it or do they want to stay in control? Look, ultimately, right, I don't think it's something. I don't think anyone enjoys ordering cartons. I don't think it's a process that people love. But having said that, it's a little bit like driving the car. You might not enjoy driving a car but then it's so painful to trust someone with it and then it blows up. You know what I mean?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Okay. So the answer is basically we all want a self driving car but then the risk is very great. But the problem is that can you.


[Speaker B]:
Build something if it fucks it up, are you going to take responsibility? And even if you take responsibility, they know 100% you're not going to pay for the downstream impact of them running out of ecardence.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. We have to make a position what's product need to be Right. Either this product to be autopilot or needs to be hybrid. Something like we give them good advice on when they should order or we just make the ordering experience really easy. It's really just three paths here with vmi, right. You either have, like I said, three modes. Number one, autopilot. Number two, we advise them on your orders, these approved and number three, we just give them complete control. But they make it very easy. Like these are the direction we have to decide. Right. I don't think AR can design for us. And then I can't really think of a fourth one for the bmi.


[Speaker B]:
It's going to do it. It should build it and it should be completely transparent. Right. I think the existing spreadsheet that it provides is. Okay. Another one that J.J. designed. The good thing about that spreadsheet is that you can actually put follow it with your eyes and you can kind of see. Oh yeah. Okay, I get it. I'm gonna, I mean like it's painful, but I can actually follow with my eyes and I say, all right, so I need those 700 grand cage free cartons. And I can say, oh, it's coming on the, on the, on the 3rd of November. Right. Okay. And I can say I'm getting more of them on the 4th of December and I'm getting another load on the 1st of January. Right now I can see it's going. I near the.


[Speaker A]:
That looks fine.


[Speaker B]:
Right. And I also need these add card and. All right, I'm going to explain it then. Oh yeah. But I'll eyeball it. Oh yeah, it looks about right. All right, I'm happy to go with it. Like if it was a black box and you're telling me just to sign up and then I just click a button and it like auto manages everything without me being able to see anything. I find that very difficult to do. Right.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, now what about something like the hybrid where we essentially do the autopilot but then we always let them approve every order we place for them and they are able to see all the data. Right. I think it's basically the spreadsheet online before they approve the plan. They're able to see after they approve, what's your inventory going to look like over the next X amount of weeks. I feel like that's kind of the hybrid approach we should go for with at least the general concept of emi. It shouldn't be fully black box.


[Speaker B]:
It has to look very similar to actually the spreadsheet that JJ did. But that spreadsheet is obviously too confusing. It has like Two tables, one on top of the other one was the time the containers leave. The other one was when the containers arrive. I don't think the customers really care about when they leave. Right.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. So basically, I need to have a look at that spreadsheet. Basically.


[Speaker B]:
It had one around the current inventory and the other one around the containers on the water had two tables, one on top of the other.


[Speaker A]:
Sorry. The current inventory is that inventory in their factory, in the farm, or inventory.


[Speaker B]:
Projected amount of inventory. So according to their sales forecast, that would actually give you their projected inventory of each product out in the future. Right. And then the road below would be when containers semicontainers either departing or landing. I can't remember. Right. And then. Yeah, and then you basically be able to eyeball both of them and see that they both align.


[Speaker A]:
So tell me, tell me, if that system is working so good, why is only five customers using it?


[Speaker B]:
That's a good question. So I think the main reason is right now. Well, there'll be a few reasons. Number one, we're not really selling it. We're not really pushing it. Right. The second one is customers are telling us that their orders are changing too fast and they don't know that they can't provide a sales force forecast out in the future. That's the biggest issue right now.


[Speaker A]:
Interesting. Okay, so the customer struggle to provide a sales forecasting to the future.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, that's right.


[Speaker A]:
And okay, right, right. You find my pack right now. You can't. You guys honestly can't provide a forecasting to the future to make your buffer stock. Right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
That's kind of the bigger problem, I guess. Okay. All right. So are these two the main reasons that MyPad customers aren't using this? Because I know you started this initiative quite a while ago. Right. I think you told me like at least more than a year ago about this whole spreadsheet idea, and it ended up just being a few customers using it. So the current customers using it, are they loving it? Like either providing actual significant value to them to the ones that are actually.


[Speaker B]:
Using it right now.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, then the only problem is that why aren't you pushing it? You're not pushing it because customer telling you they can't predict their forecast. Why don't you guys do like a monthly process on this? Let them update it monthly. And you just. In fact, the production scheduling, we have like a frozen period and then everything else after, we just dynamically adjust for them. Just redo the spreadsheet, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good Question. Look, I reckon, I reckon it's a little bit like this, right? I reckon it's a little bit like this. I think if the product was simpler to use and was kind of integrated in with MyPack online, right? I believe that. I believe, I reckon, look, the right way to do it is because all customers are currently ordering MyPak online, right?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
I reckon that's the main thing to get people to step from the current ordering system in MyPack online to trialing this. And it would be, for example, right? It would be. I'm just thinking of the simplest way for them to do it, right? Is that, right, so you have for these products, give me roughly what your sales forecast and what your current inventory is for these products, right? And then it would actually, I don't know, then say to you, look, we suggest your next order should be this, right? And it actually show you what your next order should be and then you can kind of vet it, you can kind of look at it and you say, oh, there wasn't enough of this or there wasn't enough of that.


[Speaker A]:
Right.


[Speaker B]:
You can edit it in, change the way you like, right. It just gives you a suggested order, right? And then it just does that. It just gives you a suggested order based on information that you put in. I reckon that is the simplest way to do it rather than you going in full auto mode. It's a little bit like self driving cars. I don't mind it just following the lane for me to start off with. Right. You know what I mean? You need it to kind of take a baby step there. That's what I reckon I do.


[Speaker A]:
Basically the end go initially, right, is that we want to, I don't know, I thought the document is pretty good. The end go is really to basically build that trust. We basically manage the packaging supply chain for them and they're going to be very low customers as long as we don't it up. Right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. All right, on the foot then. I'll soon start to down to something more crisp. Let's talk about. And let's move on number two, right, I actually want to get this out from you. How do farms know their current inventory today? Do they count them manually? Do they track them in spreadsheets or how do they track their inventory? Right now.


[Speaker B]:
Some of them would have it on a lot of people just counting it. Some of them on. Some would have an ERP system, some would be manually counting it, some but. But it doesn't matter. Like they just have to give it some kind of Export. They're using ERP that need to use an export.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. It's just all CSV files. At the end of the day, everything's just data. Right?


[Speaker B]:
That's easy.


[Speaker A]:
I can't adjust any data. That's. That's fine. But the question is. So all of them have a way to track their inventory, but then what's your current process to, you know, since you already know their inventory, what's your current process to figure out when they need to order? Like, who's doing that? How are they doing it?


[Speaker B]:
It's basically someone that basically just has their own Excel spreadsheet trying to figure it out themselves. I mean, it's on rocket science, right? Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
And what's the frequency? What's the frequency? They check these kind of things and make orders. What's the first thing you do is do it every month? Every week?


[Speaker B]:
Generally, like once a month.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, let's just say once a month. Right. Generally once a month, they go back and look at the inventory and they figure out, basically figure out their sales forecast and then decide how much more stock we want to buy from iPad right before they do. Okay, all right, understood. Then. Number three, I guess you already kind of told me how predictable is their usage, right? Especially right now. Like, is it very, very rand, their usage, or they kind of, I guess, irrelevant to their sales forecast, Right? Like, how bad is their sales forecast right now? Is it like completely just swinging out of the season or.


[Speaker B]:
I think that's a good question. Look, I think overall, right. Customers probably get it. Right? Probably 80, 90%. I say 80% of the time.


[Speaker A]:
So they're able to predict their usage 80% of the time.


[Speaker B]:
I mean, I wouldn't say it's optimal, but they get it. Like, they get it. They're not bad with it, right? As in they probably hold more stock than what they need to, but they get it. But the 10 or even the 5% of the time they get it wrong is so painful than running out of egg cartons that it's really, really bad for them to run out of egg cartons. Right?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. So it's very vision critical. We get this right, and it's technically a very painful problem as well. Right. Like, we're actually still in real pains here, I generally believe. Right. Because, you know, running out of packaging is not funny. So. Okay, number four, right? How long is current MyPak lead time again? Because I know you've got the production issues and then you got shipping and everything. How do you currently manage your lead time? For example, before you quote a cost line, do you actually figure out your production capacity first, what you can realistically deliver before they make an order? Or you just kind of do it by experience?


[Speaker B]:
No, I just get orders and I just shove it down the throat of production.


[Speaker A]:
But that's kind of a bad way of doing this, right? Like, that's not. If a Toyota wouldn't sell you a car before telling you how long it's going to wait, they're going to tell you you're going to wait four years for it. Then you're going to wait four years for it. But then if you sell, let's say if you Toyota and you sell a car and without telling them when it's going to arrive, normally people expect two to three months maximum, but then it's going to become four years and people get pissed.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, but the thing is, you should.


[Speaker A]:
At least tell people what the lease are.


[Speaker B]:
My problem is it's a little bit of the same problem that I have with costing. I don't feel like there's any credibility on their side. So that's why I know it's not really. It's a bit toxic, but because I don't have any credibility on them, I just kind of. I don't know, like, it's just the state of the world right now. I can't. I can't change certain things. So, yeah, I just get orders and I let them deal with it. Sorry. You probably don't think it's really the healthiest approach. That's reality that I leave right now.


[Speaker A]:
Because I'm going to be honest with you, right. If we do have an actual production scheduling system, that's least going to look at the next three months, right? You can't just be looking at the next 14 days. You're going to look at the next three months and then you're going to know how much you can sell, how much you can't, you know, like, you can't sell blindly. I think that's the wrong approach to sell. You got to sell as soon as you can deliver. Right. Anyway, I know the situation, but I'm just saying, in an ideal world, you sell things that you can actually deliver, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. Anyway.


[Speaker A]:
So I think I have a pretty good answer, like understanding of the product right now, basically. I mean, I'm still going to talk to Claude Curry. Right. From your perspective, this is going to be a very hybrid approach to the product. We want to really simplify their experience. So basically, the number One pain, right. Tell me if I'm wrong. The number one pain with your customers right now is these customers already know their sales forecast. They count their inventory maybe once a month. And they actually don't have a very good system to understand when they're going to have inventory like arriving, packaging, arriving in their warehouse. And sometimes the order be too much, sometimes the order be too little. They don't get this kind of supply chain stability and that's actually really painful for them. Right. Because for supply chains, packaging ideally want it very stable. So you have a pain. Is that painful from your perspective?


[Speaker B]:
Sorry, what's painful? Sorry.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. The pain is that they don't. Okay. The core problem is that they are really bad at managing their packaging supply chain. That's what I'm saying. They always, you know, like they've, they're terrible at managing supply chain, basically. Is that the case?


[Speaker B]:
Look, I wouldn't. Obviously they're in business so they can't be terrible at their supply chain. Right. They can't be shocking. I mean, they wouldn't be in business a little bit like us, right. If we couldn't manage our supply chain. We're in deep shit. Right. But are you telling me that my path is ordering labels and paper and wood chips and glue and everything optimally, or do we just say, let's say if we need to buy glue. Do we just say, look, give me 10 ton of glue this week. Not because of the real reason to buy 10 ton of glue, but there could be a reason to buy 10 ton glue. I don't know, but maybe it's on sale. But you know what I mean, Is there any. The problem is, I don't think that, you know how, by the scheduling system, how you're actually going to say, you know, have an actual schedule of buying labels and glue and all that sort of shit that would actually be optimal. Right. Like CLO code would actually tell us what's the right way to order glue and we would order glue that way. Right. And I think that's cool.


[Speaker A]:
That's right. That's right.


[Speaker B]:
But do we use Claude code right now to figure out how much glue to order or how many labels to order in a batch or whatever? No, I don't think we do. Right. So the point of it is, the point of it is like, do they have a system that works right now? Yes, they have a system that works right now. Right. Can it be improved? Yes. How much can it be improved? I don't know. Right. But what I want this to be Is that a system that they're going to use to order things? Because it's going to be so much easier and better than the current system. Right, let me ask you this question.


[Speaker A]:
Right, let me ask you this question. Just use my practice as an example, right? Like since how many years ago have you ever implemented a change, right. Something big around core processes in this company and people, you know, saw this is improvement, I'm going to use it. Have they ever done something like this? Because from my perspective, I'm sure, you know, like, other than ERP anything after that, which is all manual, they decided to just not use anything, optimize anything.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
And that's going to be the exact same problem with these guys as well. We propose their bmi. They look at it. Oh, that's an interesting way of doing things. All right, I'm just earning my job. I'm just earning my salary. By 5pm today, I'm going to move on. Right. It's not waste my time. But you don't have agency. You can't sell things to people without agency. That's kind of my problem. I'm concerned about, right? Like I don't want to build this product. It's going to be like two weeks later. And then we look at this product, we give to people. It's become another production schedule. And they ever want to use.


[Speaker B]:
Oh, no, the production schedule will eventually be used. I can show you. No, the production schedule will eventually be used, but I just need to move things in the company first. I need to fuck some people off first, you know what I mean?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
So don't worry about that. And by the way, I'm not worried about that.


[Speaker A]:
Trust me. Trust me. This guy's an alcohol guy. He's gonna.


[Speaker B]:
And two things, right? I needed that to get YH on board. Like we had to deliver something to get YH on board, you know, so. So I don't think it's a waste anyway.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I've done honestly the best of my ability. Right. Like whatever next, it's just gonna be future work.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
I don't have any energy to continue to improve it from. From here.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
But honestly, I think. Why is he gonna know how to do this?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Why are you just gonna know how to do this better than me? To be honest? Because he spent years learning about in algorithm design and he's gonna know how to do this a little bit better than me. I don't know. We'll find out. Okay, so for BMI then let's really like you said, I want to get a spec out for BMI and it has to be crystal clear. Right. Everything, like from design to data points, what it's going to achieve. Exactly the features that's going to sign up by me, sign up by you. Right. We're going to literally look at it for two days straight and then we sign it off. I'm only going to develop according to that spec. I'm not going to iterate well engineer. Right. Like I'm just going to do the spec right now. So right now I've got a bunch of ideas, but then I think the core thesis we can have right now based on these conversations, we want to just give them a very hybrid approach to advise them how to order inventory. And the way we do it is to let them upload their current inventory, upload their sales forecast, and then we are going to advise them how much inventory they should order and they can manually approve it. And then we're going to place them in our system and they can do this maybe on a monthly cadence or whatever. Is that kind of idea or am I wrong?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, look, I think that this product should literally, it should be baby steps, right? So we should look at basically just my pack online. Right.


[Speaker A]:
And really I know the story quite well. I look at them.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. So it should literally be an improved version of MyPak Online that allows them to just enter in the sales forecast and inventory and then recommend the next order to them.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. Okay.


[Speaker B]:
Or it could be multiple set of orders. It could be this is your next and you can literally just check the box and you can select one, you can select two, you can select five of them, you can select as many as you like and just click confirm. And that would basically place a whole bunch of orders. Does that make sense? Okay, I think that that's quite easy to start off with.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, my question for you is if I want to see it. So what's your most typical customer you think will be the best person for us to start with? And I'm going to actually look at that person's order history. Just for me to understand a little bit better, which customer do you think I should look at? Just really to know they're ordering, to see their orders most closely. I don't know which one.


[Speaker B]:
I think it would be Valley park in Agenbrook and maybe Josh's Eggs. Valley Park, Agenbrook and Josh's Eggs.


[Speaker A]:
Okay, so these are essentially going to be our early Cosmos, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah, but look, everyone's going to be using it but yeah, I'll get those three first.


[Speaker A]:
No, no, I know. We need pilots, right? We need pilots. This is not going to be a tomorrow rollout. We're going to start with five, like, because if I fuck up, I'm going to fuck out of business. I don't want to fuck up your business. Right. So we're going to do a pilot. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. So let me go on and look at this kind of companies and then I need to work on the wireframe and get the document. Now I'm going to work with Clockwork on product. I think. Enough said. I just wanted to ask you these questions because you know these questions best, and I think they're very relevant to the product as well. Yeah, you know what? I'm going to do this call, I'm actually going to pass this call to Clark Card to let it understand exactly what we're talking about, because it's going to summarize this call a little bit better than what I could. Right. Because I just took on a bunch of notes. I don't even know what hell we're talking about. And I'm going to let Clark Curtis synthesize it.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah, look, I mean, I'll maybe just summarize it by this, right? For this product, the context of this product is very simple, right? As in we. I think the value of this product is going to be around saying that we can build a VMI product, all right? And I know that there's a lot of stuff in this VMI space, but obviously I think the value of it overall is kind of like. It's a. Kind of like if you think of Alibaba as the. As a mechanism to actually, it's like kind of a marketplace to buy things, right? This is kind of what would sit on top of an Alibaba and say, look, you know, I'm running a project. I need to buy a whole bunch of stuff. You. You can put everything into this product and then it would then source it according for you, like on Alibaba or anything. I mean, ironically, it would even be things like, say if you were a construction company and you need to buy. Let's say you're Reese Plumbing and you need to buy a whole bunch of products, right? Ideally, I'm sure they have SAP or something, right? But it should be a product that they should be able to maybe plug SAP into and that would then go and find the product in the market or whatever or somehow manage it in the market. Right? But at the moment, for a company like MyPak, who doesn't use SAP. I think it is incredibly hard to manage a lot of suppliers and do it well. I don't know how many suppliers we have. I don't know how many suppliers we have across two factories.


[Speaker A]:
I have your ERP database. Right. You have zero process on managing supplies at all. Zero. It's got like millions of B2B punishes in there. Zero management there. Zero.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. So because it's so haphazard, I think the main value of it. And by the way, a lot of our customers don't have an ERP system and don't have great process for ordering packaging either. By the way you look at Konobalis, do you think Konobolus is running SAP?


[Speaker A]:
Do you think he's going to burn Canopolis? I look at the office, this is middle aged fat woman. Nah, there's no way they use any software. I don't even know if they use like something like Sage Accounting or whatever. I don't even think they use zero.


[Speaker B]:
Exactly. So the point is. But that's not a small company by the way. That's not a small company, right?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah.


[Speaker B]:
And so are they making like 100.


[Speaker A]:
Million revenue a year at least or more?


[Speaker B]:
They'll be making a bit. I don't know the number. But look, the bottom line is I think that for a lot of these companies, I mean managing procurement is actually not an easy thing to do. Not even for my part. It's an easy thing to do. Managing procurement.


[Speaker A]:
Right, of course. Purchase orders. Right.


[Speaker B]:
To all you want to do.


[Speaker A]:
I should do some research on comparisons.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. I look at competitors. There are few similar products out there that helps people to manage. Like one of the most painful things was around E commerce because E commerce site sometimes need to manage different suppliers and they actually get the same problems. Right. Actually saw the same thing there. I'll send you the website later. They need to manage their purchase orders, tracking inventory, tracking usage and they also have the artwork profile system on them as well. Say for example, you have an E commerce site, I don't know, like something big. Right. I'm talking about a very big E commerce site and they sold this kind of use cases which I think makes sense. Right. Because usually for a big company they actually get from few suppliers in China making the exact same products. For example, like you know, like I don't know, you're making a backpack or your clothing shop like you're selling clothes in the U.S. lululemon or whatever. I know Lululemon actually have like around 20 suppliers in China and managing orders, managing artworks, design, everything is very painful, you can imagine, right. And doing productive scheduling everything. And I think a lot of traditional software tackling this kind of the problem. But I feel like we are just really aiming for the B2B supply chain stability. Right. We're obviously going for B2B. We don't want to do this kind of thing. But then yeah, there are similar products on the market. People definitely realize this paying a long time ago. I'm not too concerned about it by the way. It's like, oh, you see Google building it, we shouldn't do it. You know, it's like a million business under the sun. So if we can sell this, literally we can serve my pet customers well. Trust me, we can build a really good business part of it. I'm pretty confident about it. You know this is actually I'm really confident about because I know what the scale these companies are and I know the agriculture venture capital marketing in Australia. Massive. Right. Like if egg farmers want to use it, you know Sunrise Pork, I don't know, one of those, like sun pork, whatever. All the agriculture business want to use similar things to manage their vendors. They're all very non technology savvy. Like as far as I'm concerned. Right. We just need to build the right experience for them. Long story short, you're just saying to me just really take baby steps and get it moving. Right. Then is there anything else you want to summarize the call or I would just kind of let Clark code through.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, I think that's the one. Is that we should just look at my pack online and take a baby step. I mean look, ultimately, right, we have to keep the product really simple to start off with. Yeah. I mean but ideally it needs to be like a generalist. So I'll give you an example, right? So say if you said we're using it for my pack, right. What the product would look like is to say look, for every single carton that we make, we, we need X amount of glue, right? And we need X amount of whatever. We need X amount of plastic bags, paper, whatever. Yeah. And then you'd have all those, you'd have all those things programmed in the system, right? So you say based on all these orders, this is how much glue and paper bags we need. Right? And then you'd have a rule that would say look, if we order paper bags of plastic bags, we need those plastic bags. We need to place it 12 weeks in advance and we need to also order it in A minimum quantity of say, you know, 100,000 at a time. Right. You'd have that business rule and it's all right now you just organize ordering for it. Does that make sense? So you'd have, you know, the proportions and then you know the, you know, and then you know the minimum order quantity or whatever that you, you need to order it in. And then that would automatically make orders. And how it would make orders, generally speaking, is that it would either send an email out. So you'd have some kind of email and some kind of receipt or something, or maybe even an API system or something like that. You somehow have something that would actually then send out the order and get some kind of response from the system around it. Right. Or maybe it would just.


[Speaker A]:
Well, ideally, right, you actually want your vendor because every company will have their own domain. Say for example, kinect.mypack.com or connect.kannabolis.com, every company gets their own custom domain, which is fine, everybody does it. And then your vendor can actually sign up onto this Connect platform with the company and manage all the orders there. Right. Which I think could potentially be a better experience, if you know what I mean.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
So you actually manage your entire ordering, logistics, shipping and finance payments all within the same platform?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
And it's all plugged into your accounting, plugged into your erp, however you like. Right. Just make it enterprise software.


[Speaker B]:
So actually I'm just going to show.


[Speaker A]:
You why I think it's very important.


[Speaker B]:
So I entered these into ChatGPT actually just to get some kind of. Yeah, I entered your document into ChatGPT together with some of my documents and I think it's really good. I think it's like it's basically saying that the main value proposition is the fact that you actually say it never runs out. That's the North Star of what it's suggesting.


[Speaker A]:
That's right. Because I generally find Claude to be a better assistant than ChatGPT. I don't know. ChatGPT just talks shit. I honestly have trouble understanding.


[Speaker B]:
Well, give me a copy of Claude then.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


[Speaker B]:
Do you actually have a copy?


[Speaker A]:
No, I don't. The best way for to use it is to use cold coding terminal. If it's because that's what I use, then for you maybe. Honestly, I would just buy $20 a month subscription and you just use it in Australia. I'll do it for you. That's what I do.


[Speaker B]:
$20.


[Speaker A]:
$20 a month.


[Speaker B]:
20.


[Speaker A]:
20. $20 a month.


[Speaker B]:
I thought it was 200 I'll just buy one.


[Speaker A]:
I'll just buy one. I'LL send you the login.


[Speaker B]:
I thought it was 200.


[Speaker A]:
No, no, no. I downgrade it because. Okay, four clock code, right? Because I have such huge usage, right. I don't find the power to like I'd find a relate service way to do it for you. I'll just buy you the legit thing so you can use it on your phone, on your computer. Because I know you need to use it on your phone. But I am perfectly fine using my MacBook. So I would just use. I'll buy you the features. No, no, no.


[Speaker B]:
I'll just use the card. I don't think it really makes a big difference. I use ChatGPT Pro until the license runs out. When it runs out, then I'll switch.


[Speaker A]:
Done, done, done. ChatGPT. I'm still going to subtract to the $20 a month subscription. You can still use it.


[Speaker B]:
Why?


[Speaker A]:
The current chatgpt. You just keep using it. You just keep using it.


[Speaker B]:
But why?


[Speaker A]:
Because I still have to use their product. I still have to use the codecs under their product.


[Speaker B]:
All right.


[Speaker A]:
It's not very high frequency occasionally, sometimes it solves technical problems. Clock on.


[Speaker B]:
Oh really?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. But Clock is overall Clock Holder is just the most general purpose tool. That's honestly amazing, right? Like, honestly. Don't you think this is already worth more than like I don't know because this tool probably costs 400amonth, right, for us to use it. And I kind of got why he should use it for free now I.


[Speaker B]:
Just let him use my credit Card or the ChatGPT.


[Speaker A]:
Your clock card. Clock card. Clock code. Because clock code is very expensive right at the bottom. And then I just say, you know, like I'm already using it years like whatever. I just assume you're already on board. I just let him use it. He's the one actually figuring out how to use this relay service. I said, oh no, you're already doing all the work. You just use it for free. But you manage the infrastructure for me, right? I'll pay. But then you manage all the credits because sometimes it goes off very, very fast, right? Like it's very annoying to use it sometimes because Anthropic is just blocking China. Did you know like Anthropic is a very anti China right now. They treat China as a foreign adversary and they actually try to ban all the access from mainland China to anthropic service. But ChatGPT doesn't give a fuck. Gemini doesn't give a Fuck. Just anthropic is keep just trying to ban China anyway. You just keep using chargeability plus and then whatever class think you like me to do, I'll just do it for you, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah. So anyway, have a look at what the PDF that I just sent you. Anyway, it's a bit verbose. Maybe you want to put this into whatever. Look, I think that. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. Look, I think it's. But I think it's right. So like the way that I read it, right, Is it saying that the biggest problem is right now is that it's not fully automated, right? Yeah, it's not fully automated. So I think that's really cool. I think the idea is all we want to do, right, is trying to make something that. You know how I was talking about the plastic bags and the glue and all that sort of stuff, right? The only thing that. The only variable that I should have in my business, right? I mean the inventory, I can't change the inventory is just inventory, right? So the only thing I can really tinker with almost on a day to day basis is what I think the future, my future sales will be and how much and how many weeks of stock that I should keep in my shirt, right? So I can say for this product here, I'm going to keep eight weeks of stock. So based on these sales, I can never run out of it. So I'm going to keep eight weeks of stock. But this other product, I'm happy to just keep two weeks of stock. It doesn't really matter if I run out, I can easily substitute it something else. You know what I mean?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.


[Speaker B]:
So those are the only two things and I can just change my sales forecast almost on a date. Like if some customer says, look, I need this, I can literally just punch it into the system and say, give me more or less this product, right? And just update all my orders. It should then just modify all the orders in the system accordingly to my updated sales forecast, right? Everything should get kicked off accordingly on my sales forecast.


[Speaker A]:
That's what we imagined to be for the purchase scheduling as well, right? I mean, yeah, new orders coming should automatically update your forecast, right? Like how many x1 days you look forward, right? You should change that. Yeah, I mean you should look forward for the next.


[Speaker B]:
And you know that I've got to buy at least 10 drums of glue at a time. Then you just update it accordingly, you know what I mean? And so the most important thing is to have the rules in there, right? To have the rules like each product needs X amount and all that sort of stuff. And then all I need to do is just change my dashboard of sales. That's all I need to know. I just change my dashboard of sales and the rest.


[Speaker A]:
You need to update your inventory. You need to change your dashboard sales. Right. You still have to update your inventory.


[Speaker B]:
That's right.


[Speaker A]:
If you're using less this month, I don't know, otherwise I can't plan for you.


[Speaker B]:
That's right.


[Speaker A]:
Okay.


[Speaker B]:
I mean, I think that that's the beautiful product, by the way. I mean, I think that, that yeah.


[Speaker A]:
I have a pretty good sense of how to do it.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker A]:
But can you just do me a favor this time? Can you just make sure I don't start coding anything like I don't get caught code to do anything until we look at the spec and do at least 10 times when we actually sign off? Yeah, can you just make sure I do that? Because sometimes I jump in the building a little bit too fast and I'm really scared. Like I don't want to waste time again this time. Let's be very disciplined this time. And if I'm doing it right, you just remind me, right, Ethan, hold your horses. That's really come from the product before you do it.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah. What I do also, Ethan, what I would also. That I think is also best practice. I'd actually design the UI first before coding the back end.


[Speaker A]:
That's exactly what I said. That's what I'm going to do. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm actually not even doing ui. I'm doing wireframe right now. Wireframe is very, very basic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll send to you, I'll send to.


[Speaker B]:
You after the wireframe. I'd even like code the real UI even before you put any smarts behind it.


[Speaker A]:
Yes, I would do. I would have, would have. Because changing UI is easy while you have backend plugin and changing the UI very, very painful. Changing UI without data is easy, but with real data is so bloody painful because things go wrong all the time.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Anyway, okay, so let me go on to do the wireframe now and then. So three things, right? Number one, egg box. I need to find assembly solutions for and move it forward. At least when you get a definitive solution on how to do it, maybe we're going to find someone else, I don't know. And then mature. I'll get the wireframe out for VMI and number three, FocusFlow. You write down your Exact feedback. And I will talk to Clock Code and, you know, kind of see what else needs to be done for the product. Right. I know we said we want to onboard Sophie Ling and whatever this week. Do you still think that's a good idea? Oh, by the way, what did Sophie say about the spreadsheet you sent to her? Or she just forgot?


[Speaker B]:
I don't even know if she read it. I didn't follow up. She's on leave this week, but I'll definitely install it for her first thing next week.


[Speaker A]:
Okay. All right. It's a good time for us to really debug the software as well, because tomorrow there could be some ridiculous new bugs coming out and you didn't tell me. I'll fix it. To be honest, Ethan, I think the.


[Speaker B]:
Product is very good. I'll be honest with you, I think the product is very good.


[Speaker A]:
No, no, not really. Is quite buggy, especially around processing and whatever. There's a lot of work. Honestly, you just mvp. This is still just mvp.


[Speaker B]:
But tell me, what are the bugs from your perspective?


[Speaker A]:
Mostly around integrations and process queuing. For example, if you start uploading 100 files to your Google Drive right now, there could be a race condition around the whole cache and queuing process. You can't really handle very large amount of files anyway. No, leave the technical problem to me. But if you notice any bugs, it's not processing calls or whatever, you just let me know and I'll fix it.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, yeah, okay. I mean, how would I know? I wouldn't even know if it's not processing files or not.


[Speaker A]:
I'm going to monitor daily, right? Honestly, yeah, I'm going to monitor it daily. But if the app just crashes, it's Lebaner. Yeah, I don't think we'll crash, but then I'll monitor it daily. I'm probably going to monitor more often. For example, after this call, I'm actually going to log on and look at the task it generates. Right. I'm actually going to use it because transcript is on your side. Then I can only. You can assign things to me already. By the way. You can click on the signs here and assign to Ethan and I will actually see it.


[Speaker B]:
I really like that focus play pricing strategy doc, by the way.


[Speaker A]:
All right. Right. Yeah, it's from cloud code. It's better than trading fee for sure.


[Speaker B]:
No, no, but can we just read that? I'm just going to look at the first page. Like fuck everything else, right? Actually, no, there's a few options on other pages.


[Speaker A]:
First page of what?


[Speaker B]:
Huh?


[Speaker A]:
First page.


[Speaker B]:
Of what other Focus Flow premium Pricing strategies strategy document that you sent through?


[Speaker A]:
Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm looking at the first page.


[Speaker B]:
Have you read this?


[Speaker A]:
I can't sleep at night. Yeah, I read the whole thing. I read it before I sent to you. Come on. And it's not the first, like, output. It says, I actually got a few versions. This was the version I was most happy with before I sent it to you.


[Speaker B]:
So, I mean, I think that's bang on, right? I think that that's absolutely bang on, right. I think that that's great. Constant interruptions. And I think that's great as well. You know what I mean? I can imagine a scenario, right, where, you know, like, I know, like, say if you're gonna have a meeting with, I don't know, with someone and I can say, look, don't. I'm not gonna be there because I'm busy on something, but just send me a recording or just send me whatever, you know what I mean? And I'll just add it to my to do list or whatever. Or I can access your shared memory or you can provide a summary of it to me or something like that. Right? Like, I can imagine scenarios where, like, look, you know, you know, don't even talk to me about it. You just, I don't know, talk to Cube and. Yeah, and then I would just get the transcription of it and figure out what I need to do with it. Like, you know, like, I basically. I basically just put my phone on do not disturb, and on my. Basically my voicemail, I just asked you to describe everything that you want to tell me right now, and I'll just take it on board as per my voicemail. Right?


[Speaker A]:
Yep, yep, yep. The only thing we probably want to solve later. Yeah. Like, one thing I really love to have in the future is for it to know who am I. Right. Which is solvable. It's basically the, you know, like in audio files you can actually know who's talking. It's basically to know, like, you actually can know who you are.


[Speaker B]:
I think that that's so far down our priority list right now.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, I know it's so far down the track, but I actually feel the need to do it right. Because I like to know what I said or what he said.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah, I know. But the thing is I can read it and I kind of get a general sense anyway. I just want to capture the information. I don't really care who said it. You know what I mean?


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, yeah.


[Speaker B]:
I just want to Capture it anyway. No, but I just feel that that's so strong right now and I think the product right now.


[Speaker A]:
I agree. Yeah. So you know what? Keep using it. I honestly, I want to switch them over to.


[Speaker B]:
And then you have active two stuff, which is priority paralysis that you can't really. I mean, I guess you could. But see, that's going to be solved when I can talk to my memory. Right. If I can talk to my memory in my action list, I think that's going to be really powerful because I literally just say to it, tell me, like, help me plan my day today. But I think that once again, I think the three main development priorities of the product that I can see right now is number one, figuring out how to record calls and then number two, and number three is just talk to memory and action list and combining stuff, merging stuff together. I feel that they're kind of the only three things that I can think of right now, you know, that this product needs. But I think the first problem is so big, right. That you know what I mean? It's far bigger than the next two. The next two is very doable. Right. Talking to memories piss easy and combining stuff is plausible. Like it's not that hard. Right.


[Speaker A]:
It's all doable. Yeah. We're gonna know. I'm sure AI would do a good job.


[Speaker B]:
But recording is hard. Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. And the recording thing is directly relevant to how people adopt to the product as well.


[Speaker B]:
Right.


[Speaker A]:
Because if we don't do it, then people won't adopt to the product, the whole Kubeacr thing.


[Speaker B]:
But having said that, I still reckon our strategy for that is right, we just focus on Cube ACR users.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah. And then you're going to do the marketing. Are you going to do the marketing?


[Speaker B]:
No, it's pretty much going to be you. I laugh you and I know it's going to be you.


[Speaker A]:
Yeah, I know. Or we just do. I don't know. Like we need to find actual content and teams. We can honestly, don't worry about qvcr. You need to get your friends on board. If you don't even want to sell this to people, you know, I'm not selling to anyone else.


[Speaker B]:
If you're ready to get new users or I will get people on this product. I'm actually ready to do that.


[Speaker A]:
I'm not. Okay, let's get Sophie and Ling on board first before we go crazy on it. We need to get Sophie on board. Okay.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
And honestly, if we do that, I ideally need to have another dev with me. Right. Because the shit goes wrong. Look, there's nobody on the sun that can develop a full feature product while doing the MyPAC stuff. I'm doing. I'm doing three, four projects at the same time. I'm feeling overwhelmed every day, honestly. Right. I want to just do a sprint, right? I've done my sprint for FocusFlow. Now I like to really just work out Egg Box and vmi. Now, once I'm done with VMI Egg Box, I will do the focusflow. Right? I can only do one thing at a time. I do three things at the same time. There's a lot of work just to get one thing done. Right. You look at FocusFlow, you probably, I don't know, like, it's actually a fairly complicated piece of software. A lot of underlying logic actually behind the scene. Right. For example, the process, or your call, stable doing Google Drive integration. Usually this kind of thing takes a long time to do. Like, I knew back then I'd get my pack stepped in to do it. It usually takes three months, right? But we kind of put it off in a week, which means it's going to be unstable, it's going to be untested, it's going to have bugs. So we're going to figure out a long way, right?


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
So let me work on VMI and I'll get back to vmi. Whatever. Focus for the things, you just write them down and maybe you keep them somewhere and then send some ENL process for you. But right now I'm only going to work on VMI this week and really push it. And I want to get VMI software done. Like, the only time I'm going to start working on FocusFlow is when you need to go out and sell VMI. That's when I will start working on FocusFlow.


[Speaker B]:
Okay, done.


[Speaker A]:
Airbox will just always be on the background.


[Speaker B]:
Yeah.


[Speaker A]:
All right, cool, man. I'll let it run. Let me get a wire done now. All right, cool, Fine, Thanks.
