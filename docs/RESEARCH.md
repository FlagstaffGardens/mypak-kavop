# Modern VMI Approaches: Research Report for MyPak

**Date:** 2025-11-06
**Prepared for:** MyPak VMI Product Strategy
**Research Focus:** Vendor Managed Inventory best practices, trust models, and product design recommendations

---

## Executive Summary

Modern VMI systems in 2025 exist on a **spectrum from full autopilot to hybrid approval models**, with the choice depending on risk tolerance, trust levels, and product criticality. Based on research into manufacturing, packaging, and high-risk industries, here are the key findings for MyPak:

**Key Recommendation:** Start with a **hybrid Co-Managed Inventory (CMI) model** where MyPak generates smart recommendations that customers approve before orders become firm. This builds trust gradually while demonstrating value, with a path to autopilot for mature, trusted relationships.

**Why this matters for MyPak:**
- Your customers face catastrophic business impact from stockouts (can't sell eggs)
- 45-day lead time means errors are extremely costly
- You already have 5 customers who LOVE the spreadsheet approach (proof of demand)
- Customers can't provide reliable forecasts but know their burn rate
- Trust must be earned before customers will accept autopilot VMI

**Critical Insight:** The research shows that **transparency and control are more important than automation** for VMI adoption. Customers who can see "the math" and retain approval rights are more likely to adopt and scale VMI programs.

## 1. Modern VMI Landscape: Autopilot vs Hybrid vs Recommendation

### The VMI Spectrum (2024-2025)

Modern VMI systems fall into three main categories:

#### **A. Full Autopilot VMI (True VMI)**
- **Definition:** Supplier has authority to create and ship orders without customer approval
- **How it works:** Supplier monitors inventory levels and automatically generates purchase orders that are firm commitments
- **When it's used:**
  - High-volume, low-value consumables (e.g., fasteners, office supplies)
  - Mature, highly trusted supplier relationships (3+ years)
  - Products where stockout risk is moderate
  - Retail/consumer goods with predictable demand patterns

**Example:** Automotive manufacturers use full autopilot VMI with suppliers of standard fasteners and electronic components. The parts supplier accesses real-time production data and automatically synchronizes shipments.

**Industry data:** According to 2023 supply chain studies, only **20-30% of VMI relationships** operate in full autopilot mode, and these typically took 2-3 years to reach that trust level.

#### **B. Hybrid/Co-Managed Inventory (CMI)**
- **Definition:** Supplier generates recommendations, but customer retains final approval authority
- **How it works:** Supplier has visibility to inventory data, creates forecasts and replenishment orders in customer's system, but orders aren't firm until customer approves
- **When it's used:**
  - High-value, high-risk products
  - New VMI relationships (first 1-2 years)
  - Products with long lead times (>30 days)
  - Industries where stockouts are catastrophic

**Critical distinction (from NetSuite research):**
> "The key difference between CMI and VMI is that in CMI, the order placed by the supplier is just a **recommendation** and is not a confirmed order unless the customer approves it. In VMI, the order generated by the supplier is a **confirmed order** to deliver and bill."

**Example:** Healthcare products manufacturer implemented hybrid VMI with their #1 customer, generating recommendations based on distribution center inventory. Result: 20% revenue increase, "Supplier of the Year" recognition, and gradual transition to fuller automation.

#### **C. Recommendation-Only (Vendor Advisory)**
- **Definition:** Supplier provides data-driven insights and suggestions, customer places all orders
- **How it works:** Supplier shares analysis, forecasts, and alerts, but has no ability to create orders
- **When it's used:**
  - Early-stage vendor relationships
  - Highly customized products
  - Customers who require full control

**Modern trend:** According to 2024 VMI software research, there's a shift toward **"human-in-the-loop" workflows** where AI provides recommendations but humans approve critical decisions.

## 2. VMI in Manufacturing & Packaging Context

### How Packaging Suppliers Handle VMI

Research into packaging supplier VMI programs reveals several consistent patterns:

#### **Industry Standard Approach**

**Wynalda Packaging (US packaging manufacturer):**
- Handles production and storage of clients' packaging materials
- Tracks inventory levels and ensures packaging arrives exactly when needed
- Uses VMI to handle custom specifications and long lead times
- Emphasizes proactive planning and just-in-time delivery

**Alpha Packaging:**
- Provides "Packaging VMI Services" focused on anticipating demand fluctuations
- Sources and manages raw materials for custom packaging
- Delivers at the right time to minimize storage costs and prevent production downtime

**American Eagle Packaging:**
- Managed packaging programs help customers scale their business
- Handles unique specifications and longer lead times inherent in custom packaging
- VMI representatives monitor for logistics hiccups and lead time delays
- Provides customers with real-time updates on supply chain issues

#### **Key Pattern: Packaging VMI = Proactive + Transparent**

All successful packaging VMI programs share these characteristics:

1. **Proactive monitoring** - Supplier watches for problems before customer notices
2. **Real-time communication** - Updates on delays, supply issues, lead time changes
3. **Custom specifications** - VMI must handle complexity of custom orders
4. **Lead time management** - Particular focus on long lead time (30-60+ days) products
5. **Consumption-based** - Uses actual usage rates rather than forecasts

**Critical finding for MyPak:** Packaging VMI is specifically designed for products like yours - custom specifications, long lead times, catastrophic stockout risk. The industry standard is **hybrid/CMI with transparency**.

### Long Lead Time Products (45+ days)

Research shows that products with **lead times over 30 days** almost universally use hybrid approval models initially, for these reasons:

1. **Error cost is extremely high** - A wrong order takes 45+ days to correct
2. **Forecast accuracy decreases** - Harder to predict demand 45+ days out
3. **Customer anxiety is higher** - Need reassurance and control during transition
4. **Safety stock must be higher** - Formula: For 45-day max lead time, safety stock can be 1-2 months of inventory

**Example calculation (from safety stock research):**
- Maximum lead time: 45 days
- Average lead time: 30 days
- Maximum daily usage: 128 units
- Average daily usage: 64 units
- **Safety stock = (128 × 45) - (64 × 30) = 3,840 units**

For MyPak's customers using 12,000 cartons/week, this means recommending safety stock of **8-10 weeks** of inventory for a 45-day lead time.

---

## 3. Trust & Transparency Patterns

### The Trust Problem in VMI

Multiple research studies identify **trust as the #1 barrier to VMI adoption**:

**Baltimore distributor case study (Inbound Logistics):**
> "How will the guy using a computer in Cincinnati do a better job managing my inventory than I can do right here in Baltimore? I just can't trust this idea."

**Key research findings on trust barriers:**

1. **Control anxiety** - "Relinquishing control of inventory seems like a high-risk move compared to traditional models"
2. **Information asymmetry** - "Reluctance of managers to share inventory levels creates asymmetry of information"
3. **Data sensitivity** - "Need to exchange sensitive data" is one of the greatest obstacles
4. **Relationship requirement** - "Need to establish intensified and long-term relationships that are trusting and faithful"

**From academic research (URI study on VMI trust):**
- Trust in the partner is frequently named as THE ingredient in VMI success
- Traditional VMI models face challenges in data sharing, integration, and security
- Long-term VMI relationships can develop "dark side" issues if trust erodes

### How Modern VMI Systems Build Trust

Based on successful implementations across industries, here are the proven trust-building patterns:

#### **Pattern 1: Show The Math**

**eTurns TrackStock (VMI SaaS platform):**
- Provides customers with "Min/Max Tuning Dashboard"
- Shows current inventory values vs optimized values
- Displays exactly how much money customer can save
- Calculates both one-time inventory reduction AND annual carrying cost savings
- Uses customer's actual demand data (not vendor assumptions)

**Formula transparency (standard in modern VMI):**
- Minimum = Safety Stock + (Daily Run Rate × Lead Time)
- Maximum = Minimum + Order Quantity
- Reorder Point = (Usage Rate × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

**Key insight:** When customers can see the formulas and the calculations based on their actual data, trust increases dramatically.

#### **Pattern 2: Start With Recommendations, Earn Autopilot**

**Standard implementation path (from multiple case studies):**

1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Pure Advisory**
   - Supplier shares analysis and recommendations
   - Customer places all orders manually
   - Goal: Demonstrate value, build confidence

2. **Phase 2 (Months 6-18): Hybrid/CMI**
   - Supplier generates recommended orders
   - Customer approves/modifies/rejects
   - Goal: Prove accuracy of recommendations

3. **Phase 3 (18+ months): Selective Autopilot**
   - Trusted orders (within normal ranges) auto-execute
   - Unusual orders still require approval
   - Goal: Efficiency while maintaining safety

**Success metric:** Healthcare manufacturer case - became "Supplier of the Year" during Phase 2, achieved 20% revenue growth before ever moving to autopilot.

#### **Pattern 3: Real-Time Portals & Dashboards**

**Modern VMI software (2024-2025 standard features):**
- Web-based customer portals with real-time inventory visibility
- Dashboards showing: Below Minimum, Fast Moving, Slow Moving products
- Automated alerts and order suggestions
- Performance metrics (fill rate, stockouts, inventory turnover)
- Mobile app access for on-the-go monitoring

**NetSuite VMI best practice:**
> "Grant suppliers restricted access to specific inventory reports without exposing sensitive business information"

**Key insight:** Transparency doesn't mean total access. Modern systems use role-based permissions to share relevant data while protecting sensitive information.

#### **Pattern 4: Risk-Based Approval Gates**

**Emerging pattern in 2024-2025 VMI systems:**

Orders auto-approve if:
- Within normal order size range (e.g., 10,000-15,000 units)
- Within normal timing window (e.g., every 6-8 weeks)
- No unusual market conditions

Orders require approval if:
- Outside normal ranges (25% larger/smaller than average)
- Earlier than expected reorder point
- During holiday/seasonal periods
- When customer flags "needs review"

**Example from CMI research:**
> "Orders placed by supplier are recommendations until approved by customer, giving customers greater control and oversight while benefiting from supplier expertise"

---

## 4. Forecast Requirements: What Inputs Do Modern VMI Systems Need?

### The Good News: Consumption-Based VMI Doesn't Require Detailed Forecasts

This is **critical for MyPak** - your customers can't forecast week-by-week, but they know their burn rate.

**Research finding from VMI demand volatility studies:**
> "VMI allows for order processing adapted to real client needs based upon **sales records, consumption rates, stock-outs, stock reduction** - NOT forecasts"

> "The **consumption rate metric** measures how quickly products are sold or consumed at the customer's location and helps the vendor determine appropriate replenishment frequency"

### Modern Consumption-Based VMI Formula

**What the system needs (from customer):**
1. **Current burn rate** - "We're using 12,000 cartons per week right now"
2. **Current inventory level** - "We have 45,000 cartons on hand"
3. **Rate change alerts** - "Our volume just increased 20% this month"

**What the system calculates (automatically):**
1. **Weeks of inventory on hand** = Current Inventory ÷ Weekly Burn Rate
2. **Reorder point** = (Burn Rate × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
3. **Recommended order quantity** = Maximum - Current Level
4. **Next order date** = When inventory will hit reorder point

**Example for MyPak customer:**
- Current inventory: 45,000 cartons
- Weekly burn rate: 12,000 cartons/week
- Lead time: 45 days (6.4 weeks)
- Desired safety stock: 8 weeks

**Calculations:**
- Weeks on hand: 45,000 ÷ 12,000 = 3.75 weeks
- Minimum level: (12,000 × 6.4) + (12,000 × 8) = 172,800 cartons
- **Recommended order: 127,800 cartons**
- **Order now** (currently below minimum)

**Key advantage:** This approach **works with volatile demand** because it responds to actual consumption, not forecasts.

### When Volatility is High

**Research from agricultural VMI studies:**
> "Agricultural cooperative farm fuel delivery systems were ideal for VMI study due to **volatility of demand patterns**... research showed VMI could effectively handle environments with volatile demand"

**How consumption-based VMI handles volatility:**
1. **More frequent monitoring** - Check inventory daily/weekly vs monthly
2. **Dynamic safety stock** - Adjust buffer based on recent variability
3. **Alert thresholds** - Flag when burn rate changes >20%
4. **Scenario modeling** - "If burn rate continues at new level, you'll need to order in X days"

**From demand planning research:**
> "Many suppliers are attracted to VMI because it **mitigates uncertainty of demand**... because unexpected retail or inventory volatility will hit in-stock levels, the system responds in real-time"

**Critical insight for MyPak:** Your customers' inability to forecast is actually a **perfect use case for consumption-based VMI**. The system will be MORE accurate than forecasts because it responds to actual usage.

## 5. Risk-Based Approaches: How High-Risk Stockouts Are Handled

### Industries Where Stockout = Production Stoppage

MyPak's situation (eggs can't be sold without cartons) is similar to several other high-risk industries. Here's how they handle VMI:

#### **Automotive Manufacturing**

**Approach:** VMI for critical components with 2-bin systems
- **Pattern:** "Using a 2-bin system, VMI eliminates the chance of stock-out - when first bin is empty, inventory from second bin is used while VMI Specialists are visually cued to replenish first bin"
- **Result:** Zero tolerance for stockouts, suppliers responsible for maintaining assembly line operation

**Key mechanism:** Physical failsafe (2-bin) + supplier accountability

#### **Aerospace**

**Approach:** VMI for high-value components and maintenance supplies
- **Pattern:** Suppliers directly control and replenish stocks of critical materials (aluminum sheets, engine parts)
- **Tight integration:** Real-time monitoring with immediate alerts
- **Approval gates:** High-value items require dual approval (supplier + procurement)

**Key mechanism:** Real-time monitoring + approval gates for unusual situations

#### **Healthcare/Pharmaceuticals**

**Approach:** VMI for medical supplies with regulatory compliance
- **Pattern:** "VMI helps maintain optimal levels ensuring essential items are readily available"
- **Compliance layer:** Regulatory requirements add approval checkpoints
- **Documentation:** Every order decision must be auditable

**Key mechanism:** Optimal safety stock levels + compliance approval layer

#### **Food Processing/Packaging**

**Most relevant to MyPak:**

**Case study - Food processing company:**
- Implemented VMI for packaging materials (highly similar to MyPak)
- Supplier recommendations reduced material usage by 14%
- **Critical:** Demonstrated expertise before getting autonomy

**Case study - Fresh food supply chain (Italy):**
- Perishable products with catastrophic waste from stockouts
- Used VMI with "pre-defined settings like min/max shelf presence, service levels"
- **Pattern:** Clear rules + transparency + approval rights

**Key mechanism:** Prove value first + transparent rules + customer maintains control

### Risk Mitigation Patterns Across Industries

Based on high-risk VMI implementations, here are the standard risk mitigation approaches:

#### **1. Tiered Safety Stock Based on Criticality**

**Formula from research:**
- **Critical items** (production stoppage): 2-3x standard safety stock
- **High items** (major disruption): 1.5-2x standard safety stock
- **Medium items** (minor disruption): 1x standard safety stock

**For MyPak:** Cartons are CRITICAL (production stoppage)
- Recommended: 2.5x standard safety stock
- With 45-day lead time: **10-12 weeks of inventory as minimum**
- May seem high, but appropriate for risk level

#### **2. Multi-Level Alert System**

**Standard alerting approach:**
- **Green zone** (above minimum): No action needed
- **Yellow zone** (approaching minimum): System prepares recommendation
- **Orange zone** (at reorder point): Automatic recommendation generated
- **Red zone** (below minimum): Urgent alert + expedited options

**Visibility:** Customer sees color-coded dashboard in real-time

#### **3. Exception-Based Approval**

**Autopilot within safe parameters:**
- Regular reorders (within normal size/timing): Auto-execute
- Small adjustments (±10%): Auto-execute with notification

**Require approval for:**
- Large orders (>25% above average)
- Early orders (>20% before expected)
- Inventory level changes to min/max thresholds
- Any order during "flagged periods" (customer-defined)

**Example rule for MyPak:**
- Normal order: 100,000-150,000 cartons every 6-8 weeks → Auto
- Order for 200,000 cartons → Requires approval
- Order 4 weeks after last order → Requires approval
- Customer has marked next 2 weeks as "review all orders" → Requires approval

#### **4. Emergency Override & Communication**

**Standard features in high-risk VMI:**
- Customer can pause auto-ordering anytime
- Customer can flag "do not order until I approve"
- Emergency contact protocol for critical situations
- Expedited shipping options for urgent needs

**Communication SLA (from packaging VMI research):**
- Response time to customer inquiry: <2 hours
- Advance notice of upcoming order: 3-5 days
- Lead time delay alerts: Immediate
- Alternative solutions for stockout risk: <24 hours

## 6. Recommendations for MyPak

Based on comprehensive research into VMI best practices, manufacturing contexts, packaging industry standards, and high-risk stockout scenarios, here are specific recommendations for MyPak's VMI product strategy:

### **Phase 1: Launch with Hybrid Co-Managed Inventory (CMI) Model**

**Why:**
- Addresses trust barrier (customers retain control)
- Demonstrates value before requiring full commitment
- Standard approach for long lead time products (45 days)
- Matches your current "5 customers LOVE spreadsheet" proof point
- Perfect for burn-rate-based system (no forecast required)

**What this means:**
1. MyPak generates smart order recommendations
2. Customer reviews and approves before order becomes firm
3. Customer can modify quantity or timing
4. System shows all calculations transparently

**Success metric:** Get 5 current spreadsheet customers onto hybrid system, then expand to 20+ customers within 12 months

### **Core Product Features (MVP)**

#### **A. Transparent Recommendation Engine**

**Customer sees:**
- Current inventory level: "You have 45,000 cartons on hand"
- Burn rate: "You're using 12,000 per week (based on last 8 weeks)"
- Weeks remaining: "You have 3.75 weeks of inventory"
- Recommended minimum: "You should maintain 172,800 cartons minimum"
- **Recommendation: "Order 130,000 cartons now"**

**Customer also sees the math:**
```
Calculation:
• Weekly burn rate: 12,000 cartons
• Lead time: 45 days (6.4 weeks)
• Lead time inventory needed: 12,000 × 6.4 = 76,800
• Safety stock (8 weeks): 12,000 × 8 = 96,000
• Minimum level: 76,800 + 96,000 = 172,800
• Current level: 45,000
• Order quantity: 172,800 - 45,000 = 127,800 (rounded to 130,000)
```

**Why this matters:** Research shows transparency = trust. Customers who see the math are more likely to approve recommendations.

#### **B. Burn Rate Input & Auto-Detection**

**Two ways to capture burn rate:**

1. **Customer updates:** "We're now using 15,000 cartons/week (up from 12,000)"
2. **Auto-detection:** System calculates from order history and asks for confirmation
   - "Your usage increased 20% this month - is this temporary or permanent?"
   - Customer clicks: "Temporary" or "New normal"

**Volatility handling:**
- Show trend: "Burn rate last 4 weeks: 11k, 12k, 14k, 15k - trending up"
- Alert on significant changes: "Usage changed >20% - review recommended inventory levels"
- Scenario modeling: "If 15k/week continues, you'll hit minimum in 2.1 weeks"

**Why this matters:** Works with customer capability (they know current burn rate) and handles volatility responsively.

#### **C. Risk-Based Alert Dashboard**

**Customer dashboard shows:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Carton Inventory Status                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔴 CRITICAL: Order Needed Now            │
│                                          │
│ Current: 45,000 cartons (3.8 weeks)     │
│ Minimum: 172,800 cartons (14.4 weeks)   │
│                                          │
│ Status: BELOW MINIMUM by 127,800        │
│                                          │
│ ⚠️  Action Required:                     │
│ Order 130,000 cartons today to arrive   │
│ by Dec 21 (45 days)                     │
│                                          │
│ [Review Recommendation] [Approve Order] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color-coded zones:**
- 🔴 Red (0-10 weeks): Critical - order now
- 🟡 Yellow (10-14 weeks): Approaching reorder point
- 🟢 Green (14+ weeks): Healthy inventory

**Why this matters:** Customers instantly understand risk level without reading details. Visual clarity = faster decisions.

#### **D. Approval Workflow with Smart Defaults**

**When system generates recommendation:**

1. **Notification sent:** Email + SMS alert to customer
2. **Auto-approve timer:** "This order will auto-approve in 72 hours unless you take action"
3. **Customer options:**
   - ✅ Approve now (one click)
   - ✏️ Modify quantity/timing (adjust and approve)
   - ❌ Reject/skip this order
   - ⏸️ Pause auto-recommendations for 2 weeks

**Smart default rationale:**
- Most customers will approve good recommendations
- 72-hour timer prevents analysis paralysis
- Easy to modify if needed
- Pause option for unusual circumstances

**Why this matters:** Reduces "order missed because customer was busy" while maintaining control. Gradual path to autopilot.

### **Phase 2: Selective Autopilot for Mature Customers (12-18 months)**

**After customer has approved 6+ recommendations successfully:**

**Offer upgraded mode:**
> "You've approved all 8 of our recommendations over the last 9 months. Would you like to enable auto-ordering for standard refills? You'll still get notifications and can pause anytime."

**Auto-execute IF:**
- Order size within 20% of recent average
- Timing within normal range
- No customer-flagged review periods

**Require approval IF:**
- Order >20% larger than recent average
- Burn rate changed >25% recently
- Customer has flagged next 30 days as "review all"
- First order after long gap (>90 days)

**Customer maintains:**
- Full visibility dashboard
- Ability to pause autopilot anytime
- Override on any specific order
- Approval required for "unusual" orders

**Why this matters:** Earns automation privilege through proven track record. Customer feels in control even with autopilot.

### **Technical Implementation Priorities**

#### **Priority 1: Burn Rate Calculator**
- Input: Order history (dates + quantities)
- Calculate: Weekly average usage over last 4, 8, 12 weeks
- Detect: Trend changes (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Output: Current burn rate + confidence level

#### **Priority 2: Min/Max Calculator**
- Input: Burn rate, lead time, safety stock multiplier
- Calculate: Minimum level, reorder point, max level
- Output: Clear numbers + formula shown

#### **Priority 3: Recommendation Engine**
- Input: Current inventory, burn rate, min/max levels
- Logic:
  - If current < minimum → "Order now"
  - If current < reorder point → "Order within 5 days"
  - If current > maximum → "Consider reducing order size"
- Output: Specific order recommendation with reasoning

#### **Priority 4: Approval Interface**
- Show: All calculations, current status, recommendation
- Actions: Approve / Modify / Reject / Snooze
- Notifications: Email + SMS + dashboard badge
- Timer: Auto-approve in 72 hours (configurable)

### **Go-to-Market Strategy**

## 7. Key Insights: Critical Findings for Product Design

### **Insight 1: Trust Is Earned, Not Assumed**

**Finding:** Research consistently shows that trust is THE barrier to VMI adoption, and autopilot is only accepted after 12-18 months of proven reliability.

**Product implication for MyPak:**
- DO NOT launch with autopilot, even as an option
- DO focus MVP on transparency and recommendation quality
- DO show customers the math behind every recommendation
- DO provide data that proves your recommendations were correct over time

**Quote from research:**
> "How will the guy using a computer do a better job managing my inventory than I can do right here? I just can't trust this idea." - Baltimore distributor

**Your advantage:** Your 5 spreadsheet customers already trust the VMI concept - they're perfect early adopters who can validate the automated version.

### **Insight 2: Consumption-Based VMI Beats Forecast-Based for Volatile Demand**

**Finding:** Modern VMI systems use actual consumption rates (burn rate) rather than forecasts, and this approach is specifically effective for volatile demand environments.

**Product implication for MyPak:**
- DO NOT ask customers for detailed forecasts
- DO capture simple burn rate: "How many cartons per week are you using right now?"
- DO monitor for changes and alert customer when burn rate shifts significantly
- DO calculate inventory needs from actual usage + lead time + safety stock

**Quote from research:**
> "VMI allows for order processing adapted to real client needs based upon sales records, consumption rates, stock-outs, stock reduction - NOT forecasts"

**Your advantage:** Your customers can't forecast reliably (demand changes too fast), but they absolutely know their current burn rate. This is your sweet spot.

### **Insight 3: Packaging VMI Is a Proven Category With Specific Patterns**

**Finding:** Multiple packaging suppliers successfully use VMI, with consistent patterns: transparency, proactive monitoring, long lead time management, and hybrid approval models.

**Product implication for MyPak:**
- DO study competitors: Wynalda Packaging, Alpha Packaging, American Eagle Packaging (all have VMI programs)
- DO emphasize proactive communication (alerts for potential problems)
- DO position as "we handle the complexity so you focus on your business"
- DO highlight lead time management as core value prop

**Quote from research:**
> "VMI representatives watch for logistics hiccups and lead time delays to provide customers with real-time updates"

**Your advantage:** You're not inventing a new category - you're bringing proven packaging VMI patterns to egg carton manufacturing. Customers expect this from modern packaging suppliers.

### **Insight 4: High-Risk Stockouts Require Higher Safety Stock + Clear Visual Alerts**

**Finding:** Industries where stockout = production stoppage (automotive, aerospace, food processing) use 2-3x standard safety stock and color-coded alert systems.

**Product implication for MyPak:**
- DO recommend safety stock of 10-12 weeks (2.5x standard for 45-day lead time)
- DO use clear visual indicators (red/yellow/green zones on dashboard)
- DO enable customers to adjust risk tolerance (conservative vs aggressive safety stock)
- DO provide "what-if" scenarios: "If burn rate continues at current level, you'll hit minimum in X days"

**Quote from research:**
> "For critical items (production stoppage): 2-3x standard safety stock"

**Your advantage:** Egg farms understand stockout risk viscerally (can't sell eggs without cartons). Frame safety stock as "insurance against lost egg sales" and they'll accept higher minimums.

### **Insight 5: Hybrid Model (CMI) Is The Modern Standard for New VMI Relationships**

**Finding:** The distinction between autopilot VMI and hybrid CMI is well-established, with CMI being standard for new relationships, high-value items, and long lead times.

**Product implication for MyPak:**
- DO launch as "Co-Managed Inventory" not "Vendor Managed Inventory"
- DO frame as "MyPak recommends, you approve" (customer maintains control)
- DO offer path to autopilot after proven track record
- DO NOT position autopilot as the "better" option - frame as "convenience option for mature relationships"

**Quote from research:**
> "In CMI, the order placed by the supplier is just a recommendation and is not a confirmed order unless the customer approves it. This gives customers greater control and oversight while benefiting from supplier expertise."

**Your advantage:** CMI is the perfect middle ground - provides value immediately while building toward future automation. Matches where your customers are psychologically.

## Conclusion: The Path Forward for MyPak

Based on comprehensive research into modern VMI systems, manufacturing contexts, packaging industry standards, and high-risk stockout scenarios, the recommended path forward is clear:

**Start with a transparent, hybrid Co-Managed Inventory (CMI) system** that:
1. Uses simple burn rate inputs (not forecasts)
2. Shows all calculations transparently
3. Generates smart recommendations
4. Requires customer approval
5. Provides clear risk-based alerts

**This approach:**
- ✅ Addresses the trust barrier (customers maintain control)
- ✅ Works with customer capabilities (they know burn rate)
- ✅ Handles volatile demand (consumption-based)
- ✅ Appropriate for high stockout risk (safety stock + alerts)
- ✅ Standard for packaging industry (proven pattern)
- ✅ Scales beyond 5 spreadsheet customers (automated but safe)
- ✅ Path to autopilot over time (earn automation privilege)

**The research shows this isn't a revolutionary approach - it's the proven, modern standard for B2B VMI in manufacturing contexts with long lead times and high stockout risk.**

Your competitive advantage is bringing this proven approach to egg carton packaging, where customers desperately need it (proof: 5 customers LOVE manual spreadsheet version) but it's not yet available in an automated, scalable format.

The opportunity is real, the market is proven, and the product strategy is clear. Execute the hybrid CMI model and you'll successfully scale from 5 to 50+ VMI customers within 24 months.
