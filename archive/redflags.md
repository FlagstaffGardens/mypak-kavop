 Red Flags

  1. Data Entry Burden

  Question: Do farms actually track stock levels and weekly consumption today?

  If NO: You're asking them to start a new habit. That's a massive adoption barrier. They won't do it.

  If YES (in spreadsheets): Now we're talking. You're digitizing existing behavior. Much easier sell.

  My bet: Most eyeball it. "We've got about 3 pallets left, better call MyPak."

  2. Consumption Variability

  Weekly consumption of 3,350 is neat in a demo. Reality:
  - Week 1: 2,800 (customer canceled)
  - Week 2: 5,200 (new contract)
  - Week 3: 3,100 (holiday slow down)
  - Week 4: 4,500 (catch up)

  Your recommendations will be wrong within 2 weeks.

  Unless consumption is very stable, this falls apart fast.

  3. Relationship vs Algorithm

  Current state: "Hey John at MyPak, we're running low, can you get us a container by end of month?"

  Your state: "The portal says order by Feb 18."

  Question: Will they trust the algo or call John anyway?

  In B2B, especially with commodities, relationships > efficiency. They probably like calling their rep.

  4. Is the Pain Real?

  Stockouts: How often do they actually run out? Once a year? Never?

  If stockouts are rare, you're solving a non-problem.

  Over-ordering: Do they actually care? Buffer stock might be worth the peace of mind.

  5. Switching Cost

  Current: Call/email when needed. Zero learning curve.

  Your product: Learn portal, enter data, trust recommendations.

  Why would they switch? Unless current process is actively painful, inertia wins.

  What Would Make This Valuable

  ✅ Distributors already use spreadsheets to track this (you're just making their life easier)
  ✅ Stockouts happen often and cause real lost sales (painful problem)
  ✅ MyPak lead times are long/unpredictable (6+ weeks, making planning critical)
  ✅ They order frequently (monthly+, so portal worth learning)
  ✅ Consumption is predictable (stable business, recommendations are accurate)

  ---
  What Would Kill This

  ❌ They don't track inventory (too manual to start now)
  ❌ They prefer calling their rep (relationship > portal)
  ❌ Stockouts are rare (not painful enough)
  ❌ Consumption varies wildly (recommendations always wrong)
  ❌ They order 2-3x/year (portal overhead not worth it)
